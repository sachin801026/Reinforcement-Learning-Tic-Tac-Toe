Rules of the Game:
1. The game will be played on a 3x3 grid (9 cells) using numbers from 1 to 9. Each number can be used exactly once in the entire grid.

2. There are two players: one is the Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent and other is the environment.

3. The RL agent is given odd numbers {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} and the environment is given the even numbers {2, 4, 6, 8}

4. Each of them takes a turn. The player with odd numbers always goes first.

5. At each round, a player puts one unused number on a blank spot.

6. The objective is to make 15 points in a row, column or a diagonal. The player can use the opponent's numbers in the grid to make 15.

7. The game terminates when any one of the players makes 15.
